\opening{
  Hi, I'm Anders, and I'm really excited to be able to apply for the position as \textit{Senior Engineering Manager} with your team in Copenhagen.
}
\makelettertitle

I'm excited bacause having a deeper purpose in my work life is really important to me, and working to support and foster \textit{creativity, curiosity and imagination} really motivates me.

I'm convinced that LEGO and I share a lot of values, which I believe makes me a good candidate for the position.

Latest I've been a key player in the success of Zetland, where I had the overall technical responsibility of building a world class platform for distributing high quality journalism in close coorporation with the product team.

Now I'm ready to take the next steps in my career, and focus even more on leading and sharing my views on technology while feeling that I contribute in a tangible way.

But now I'm ready to take the next step, and focus my attention on what matters most to me. The intersection between humans and technology.

My views on software are formed both by my years with hands-on experience, but just as much by reading and practicing principles from books like Designing Everyday Things by Don Norman and Domain-Driven Design by Eric Evans.

I will contribute with an diplomatic and empathic person, and I am genuinely interested in making people feel good, motivated and safe.


Having a technical background with human-centric opinions on what makes good software, makes me a good candidate for compasionately leading a team of engineers and partnering with product teams.


I have a good eye for UX and can help the product team make their solutions technically feasible and help the engineers making their solutions more human.

I love working with people on making software and I love techonology. Oh, and I love building with LEGO with my kids.
